Basically, this script warm-up solr shards and monitor for scheduled timeframe (sceduling can be done from cron job)...
Once, this script run for several days/hours/weeks/etc - it warm up the solr shard and searching become faster.

Defaut - solr port if 7575 (can be alter to a required one)

I did this for solr search for company & contact deatils.
